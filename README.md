Problem: Find the shortest path between two positions for a knight piece in chess.

Solution: Uses breadth-first-search to traverse a graph. The knightMoves function accepts a starting and ending node, and finds the quickest path by creating an array of all possible moves from one spot, filtering it to be only positions on the board, and then filtering it once again to only nodes that haven't been visited yet. The filtered array is then added to a queue. Once a node leaves a queue, it is added to the visitedNodes array, and it's possible moves are once again added to the queue. Once the ending node is added to the visitedNodes array, the ending node and it's parents are added to an array in reverse order. Finally, an array with just the positions of these nodes is created, and this is then outputted.
